## Problems

- [#1](/1) Given a list of numbers and a number `k`, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to `k`.
- [#2](/2) Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index `i` of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at `i`.
